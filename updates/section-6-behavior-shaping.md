## Update Log

### December 2025: [Example Entry - Delete This]

**What Changed**: Hypothetical new paper shows DPO outperforms PPO on trait stability  
**Relevance**: Section 6.1 discusses PPO as primary RL algorithm  
**Sources**: 
- Paper: [arXiv link]
- Blog: [implementation guide]
**Action**: Readers implementing RLHF should now evaluate DPO as primary option

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Moderate â€” Core principles unchanged, but implementation recommendations evolving

## Active Monitoring

Currently tracking:
- [ ] DPO vs PPO comparative studies
- [ ] Constitutional AI scaling experiments
- [ ] Multi-objective reward balancing improvements
- [ ] RLAIF critic model architectures

## No Major Changes

âœ… As of October 2025, Section 6.1 content remains current and accurate.

_(Updates will appear here as the field evolves)_
